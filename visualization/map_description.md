Connect America Fund (CAF) Phase I Round Two

Description
-----------
This map shows the areas where new broadband may be deployed as a result of the second round of Connect America Phase I.  In their initial elections, price cap carriers requested over $385 million in Connect America Phase I incremental support, committing to bring broadband by 2012 to over 600,000 locations that previously lacked access.  Some of these carrier acceptances are contingent upon the carriers prevailing in challenges regarding whether certain census blocks are unserved.  Furthermore, after providing the Commission with notice, carriers have the ability to alter deployment plans to other unserved census blocks, which could result in more or less funding being allocated to any given area.  Additionally, as not all carriers provided a count of locations they planned to deploy to in each census block, some of these figures are estimates.

Number of locations per census block estimated by FCC staff for AT&T, Frontier, and Hawaiian Telecom.
